# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (once per clone / after dependency changes).
npm install

# Build — warnings are errors (strict tsconfig); emits dist/.
npm run build

# Run all tests (Vitest).
npm test

# Type-check src + tests without emitting.
npm run typecheck

# Format / lint (Biome).
npm run format
npm run lint
```

## Architecture

> **Fill this in for `__ProjectName__`.** Describe the public surface, the main
> types, and any non-obvious design decisions so an agent can navigate the code
> without re-deriving the structure each time.

The source lives in `src/` and tests in `tests/`. Keep the public API surface
small and intentional, re-export it from `src/index.ts`, keep implementation
details internal, and prefer simple, direct code over new abstractions. The
package is ESM-only; relative imports carry the `.js` extension (`NodeNext`).

## Conventions

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the authoritative conventions: dependencies, build
ordering, formatting, error-handling style, changelog rules, and the release
process. The most load-bearing rules:

- Strict typing (`tsc`), lint (`biome`), and tests are gates; keep the public API
  minimal and intentional.
- Every user-visible change ships its `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `## [Unreleased]`
  in the same change set (auto-fill from git log is a fallback, not the default).
- The release workflow's publish step is the single irreversible pivot — see
  AGENTS.md → "Release".

## Agent instruction files (in repos created from this template)

This applies to a repo **created from a template**, not the template itself (here
they stay tracked and pushed). Downstream, keep `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
`.claude/` **git-ignored and untracked** so they stay on disk for tooling but never
reach the remote — a by-hand step before the first push (the init script does not do
it). Recipe: the "Agent instruction files are local-only in generated repos" section
of [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), or `docs/AGENT-INIT-GUIDE.md` while it exists.

## Version control workflow

The repo uses [jujutsu (`jj`)](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/) colocated with git. Use
`jj` commands. Describe work early (`jj describe -m`), publish through a feature
bookmark per PR (never advance `main` locally), and sync only on the user's explicit
`pull`/`push` trigger. Full workflow in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) → "Version control".
